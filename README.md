## Features

- Calculate MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 hashes of text.
- Encrypt messages with a custom key.
- Decrypt encrypted messages with the same key.
- User-friendly graphical interface.

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, you need to have Python installed on your system. This application uses the `hashlib` library, which is part of Python's standard library and doesn't require additional installation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/kpradeep-UK/Basic-Cryptography-GUI-Python.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd Basic-Cryptography-GUI-Python
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```
   python hashing_and_encryption_tool.py
   ```

The graphical interface will open, allowing you to perform hashing and encryption operations.

## Usage

1. **Hashing:**
   - Enter the text you want to hash.
   - Click on the respective hash button (MD5, SHA1, or SHA256).
   - The hashed value will be displayed in the result area.

2. **Encryption:**
   - Enter the text you want to encrypt.
   - Enter an encryption key.
   - Click the "Encrypt" button.
   - The encrypted message and encryption key will be displayed in the result area.

3. **Decryption:**
   - To decrypt a message, enter the encrypted message.
   - Enter the same encryption key that was used for encryption.
   - Click the "Decrypt" button.
   - The decrypted message will be displayed in the result area.
